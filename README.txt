Eve
A collaborative research project between Devin Durham (DevinDurham@live.com) & Josiah Hopkins () on the evolution of code. The core idea is to have a program write, edit, and evolve code towards the most optimal function without loss of generality. We will be building a simple language environment (much like assembly) in Java to limit the complexity but retain the versatility.
